****Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

This app requirements where to have a functioning inventory process, where one could add items, update, read and delete. A function to enable sms notifications when low inventory was seen in the inventory page. create a database for the inventory as well. we also needed to have a account login screen with account creation option fully functioning and a database tos tore user data as well. this app is intended to meet the needs of the client. this addresses the need for inventory tracking and maintaing of the same. 

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

A successful user-centered UI focuses on understanding and addressing user needs through intuitive design, clear navigation, and responsive features that enhance the overall user experience. My designs have all the things a user might need to navigate and also cuztomize the way the app looks. 

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

I did a lot of research and also got some advice from people I know work in this. I also received user feedback from people close to me family, that saw the app while developing and gave me their insight. 

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

I tested the app after every big change and one screen ( java file and xml file) at a time to ensure they were working. when one called another then I went back and forth. alot of testing was involved and it is important to test as you go, not to wait until the end and then want to test everything. Otherwise the fixes are monumental and the error log or logcat is insane to look at when running. 

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

I mostly tried maintaing a peaceful calm mind and not rushing, also took mental breaks, as sometimes this is not shown in the class, but it needs to be done to be productive as well. 

**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?****
I believe in the logo application and the xml configuration in the java file.
